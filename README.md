later, if ... if ... it's possible to not take everything so serious.

Oh, I thought I wrote "it's possible _we_ do not" but like this it's fine. From a beginning being driven/chased from 2017 on I remember it was a main importance to explain a general unnecessaty for people to have hard times as in the word "suffer" because it went rather good so far. That was "in the air" to face as a possible rumour people would think like that.

This dream world would include, from everyone understanding how one could model ones life with financial means to a big house, that the society also/rather finances a 15 room house as in social security than _having_ people to take wrong decisions to keep a living standard and a sane: poor people think mainly rich people can be jealous on a struggling? life (that is experiencing warm sunshine after a cold night partially) and taking off the load of biographies that did things wrong by explaining a state of "no words do the work placeholder is simply things went wrong" in a same miraculous change of behaviour.  Declaring a ceiling for what was to achieve by acting smart-good is causing your caution if you can approach the thoughts gifted with the feeling to have responsibility. The risks one would see are are not logically seen within these words/terms. That would simply not be logic to include risks in these ideas.
